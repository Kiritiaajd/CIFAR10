# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project

The **CIFAR-10** dataset is a widely used benchmark in the field of machine learning, particularly for image classification tasks. It consists of **60,000 32x32 color images** divided into **10 different classes**. Each class has **6,000 images**, representing objects such as animals, vehicles, and other everyday items. In this project, I utilized **PyTorch** to implement a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for classifying these images into their respective categories.

## Project Overview

In this project, I built a **CNN model** to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal was to:
1. Preprocess the dataset for training.
2. Build and train a CNN to classify the images.
3. Evaluate the model’s performance on the test set.

## Dataset Details

The **CIFAR-10** dataset is divided into two parts:
- **Training Set**: 50,000 labeled images.
- **Test Set**: 10,000 labeled images.

Each image is **32x32 pixels** in size and belongs to one of the following 10 classes:
1. **Airplane**
2. **Automobile**
3. **Bird**
4. **Cat**
5. **Deer**
6. **Dog**
7. **Frog**
8. **Horse**
9. **Ship**
10. **Truck**

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
- **Loading Data**: The dataset was loaded using `torchvision.datasets`.
- **Normalization**: The pixel values of the images were normalized to standardize them for model training.

### 2. Model Building:
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A CNN was built with several convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- **Activation Functions**: **ReLU** activations were used for hidden layers, and **Softmax** was used for multi-class classification.

### 3. Training:
- **Optimizer**: The model was trained using the **Adam Optimizer**.
- **Loss Function**: **Cross-Entropy Loss** was used for multi-class classification.
- **Monitoring**: Accuracy was monitored during training using **training loss** and **validation accuracy**.

### 4. Evaluation:
- **Test Performance**: The trained model was evaluated on the test dataset.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess model performance.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualized the confusion matrix to understand how well the model performed across different classes.

### 5. Model Saving and Loading:
- **Model Saving**: The trained model was saved for future use.
- **Model Loading**: The saved model was loaded to make predictions on new, unseen images.

## Results

After training the CNN, the model achieved an impressive **accuracy of around 90%** on the CIFAR-10 test set. Performance was further analyzed using:
- **Confusion Matrix**: Helped identify how well the model classified each class.
- **Classification Report**: Provided metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

## Challenges Faced

- **Overfitting**: Initially, the model showed signs of overfitting. To address this, techniques like **data augmentation**, **dropout**, and **early stopping** were implemented.
- **Computational Resources**: Training deep neural networks on a large dataset like CIFAR-10 required substantial computational power. Using **GPUs** helped reduce training time significantly.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** can be applied to classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. By following best practices in model building and evaluation, the CNN achieved strong performance in classifying images into 10 distinct categories.

## Future Work

### 1. **Model Improvements**:
   - Experiment with deeper architectures such as **ResNet** or **VGG** for better accuracy.
   
### 2. **Transfer Learning**:
   - Utilize pre-trained models and fine-tune them on CIFAR-10 to improve results.

### 3. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Implement more data augmentation techniques to increase the training set’s size and diversity, helping improve generalization.
